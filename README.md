# Hands-on Machine Learning Projects with Python

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project focuses on the implementation and training of machine learning algorithms in python without using ML libraries.   

This repository contains the following projects:
* [Iris 2D-plot](https://github.com/simeonbabatunde/Hands-on-ML-Projects/tree/master/iris-2D-plot)  
* [k-nearest-neighbor](https://github.com/simeonbabatunde/Hands-on-ML-Projects/tree/master/k-nearest-neighbor) 
* [linear-regression and neural-networks](https://github.com/simeonbabatunde/Hands-on-ML-Projects/tree/master/linear-regression%20and%20neural-networks)
* [logistic-regression](https://github.com/simeonbabatunde/Hands-on-ML-Projects/tree/master/logisticpregression) 
* [naive-bayes-classifier](https://github.com/simeonbabatunde/Hands-on-ML-Projects/tree/master/naive-bayes-classifier)
