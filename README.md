# Hands-on Machine Learning Projects with Python

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project focuses on the implementation and training of machine learning algorithms in python without using ML libraries.   

Ths repository contains the following projects:
* Project 0 [Iris 2D-plot](https://github.com/simeonbabatunde/embedded-deep-learning-for-autonomous-vehicles/blob/main/cacc_application.ipynb) file contains the different steps taken to load, clean and noromalize traffic data. This is followed by training, optimizing and conversion of a tensforlow saved model to tensorflow lite model. It finally describes how to export the final .tflite model. 
* The [predict.py](https://github.com/simeonbabatunde/embedded-deep-learning-for-autonomous-vehicles/blob/main/predict.py) script uses TFlite interpreter on the embedded device to predict inter-vehicle distance of the CACC application using six vehicle mobility features. It describes how to Load the trained TFLite model and how to allocate tensors.
